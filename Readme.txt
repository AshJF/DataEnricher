The "main.py" contains the Python code for the desired enrichment of the data.
"Requirements.txt" has been included and it contains the names of the required Python libraries.

2) Extract or Clone all the files to a folder in your machine.
2) Click on the "run.bat" with necessary permissions.
3) Close the resulting command prompt window once all commands are executed.
